.snowpack cache - Do not edit this directory!

The ".snowpack" cache directory is fully managed for you by Snowpack. 
Manual changes that you make to the files inside could break things.

Commit this directory to source control to speed up cold starts.

Found an issue? You can always delete the ".snowpack" 
directory and Snowpack will recreate it on next run.
